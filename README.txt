This github rep will store all our projects we will be working on.

for now I have decided to use a HTML5 framework/engine called PHASER

to get everything up and running is simple

1. go to your XAMPP directory and go into the htdocs folder
2. drag and drop the BaseGame folder into the htdocs folder
3. run XAMPP
4. type into browsers address bar http://localhost/BaseGame/index.html

play!

Note: The game has some documentation I implemented, get to learn the engine, fuck around with it, do whatever you want
with it so you can get used to it!

Note 2:
To find all the documentation as well as some more examples go to this link and download everything in the github:

https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser

just look in the docs folder!

Note 3: I will keep looking for more engines/intersting editors, maybe i'll find something intersting!
